2. Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. All codes already setup, test using: pytest test_tokenizer.py -v
4. Run the flask app: python app.py
5. Run the streamlit UI app: streamlit run streamlit_app.py
[Note as flask app handles the appi requests, its important to run it before streamlit app]
